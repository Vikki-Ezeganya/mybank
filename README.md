## mybank
This bank project offers a REST API that lets you find and create transactions.
A transaction consists of an id, an amount, a timestamp and a reference string i.e ("eating out at mcdonalds"). 
The API should returns JSON and uses an embedded Tomcat, a servlet and the appropriate services for this.
